    A spirit in the sky
    fly through the night
    it sleeps and it dreams

    Dreams of endless days
    with kisses everyday
    with kisses everywhere

    Emiliana, on your pillow
    you dream to climb a willow
    reaching for the sun
    and see me on the ground

    Emiliana, I see you there
    come over down to me
    let's stay together
    let's stay forever
