    This day is gone, I've had enough
    The evening setting his big laugh
    On our lives and everything we do
    But I know a solution, and there I'm going to
    I need rest I need to sleep
    I need peace I need to dream
    With this method I know
    Everything is in flow
    Yoga nidra, power nap king!
    Wake up feelin’ like I rule everything!
    Stress be gone, I just recline,
    Floatin’ through life like a cosmic design!
    One hour feels like I slept all night,
    Brain so fresh, got my chakras bright.
    Who needs coffee? Who needs tea?
    Yoga nidra got me free
    Guided voice says “Relax your toes,”
    I’m zoned out, where my body goes?
    Ain’t no dreams, just that limbo state,
    Brain waves vibin’ at a chill-out rate.
    Alpha, theta, brain in sync,
    Third eye open, lemme take a blink.
    Yoga nidra, power nap king!
    Wake up feelin’ like I rule everything!
    Stress be gone, I just recline,
    Floatin’ through life like a cosmic design!
